* Initial powerpoint is best created using a Template or previous powerpoint. This usually works best from Work laptop at physical Desk location with focus on initial project creation, ideation on background, content, getting the powerpoint started.
* Once the draft is done, work can be done anywhere from any device. An hour later I am downstairs in living room and remember I wanted to add a bullet to slide 5 for my talking points. Flip open iPad, open the powerpoint using OneDrive, edit the slide and make a note, close.
* If the scenario is complicated like needing to add a photo or image from the web or prior art, using the iPad or phone somewhere else is impractical. Copy/Paste for slides and complex slide editing really only works reliably on a true windows computer/laptop. I have to wait until I am in work focus mode, go to the desk environment, or bring one of the laptops down (not the ipad), to make critical Edits. 
* I email the link to the powerpoint (or the physical powerpoint file for those who still don't understand the Cloud and collaboration, of which there are far too many still but shrinking) to a small group. This works best from Desktop but can be from laptop roaming work in the house.
* Receiving the email back with notes/comments/questions. If I am on the couch and get the email and it requires complex edits, I have to go back upstairs to the office to edit the powerpoint. If its just email trading comments, I can reply from the couch and finish that round of interaction. 
* I still travel around some, not as much at the moment by far, but I might only have my phone at the dentist office or car repair, and get notes about this project. I can use Office products on android and read the emails, even open the powerpoint and see what the discussion is. I rarely if ever trust editing the powerpoint on my phone.

These tabs, and their children, may get closed over a month as I work my way through the content. The near universal software in this picture is the browser, and right now that is Chrome. There may be Adobe Acrobat or kindle software, but if I can use the browser, that is my preference. It frees me from caring about Microsoft vs Google vs Apple vs Amazon.

I have always wanted a much more seamless interaction of applications across my devices.  I've written blog entries about an application model I want, which I call personal application omnipresence.  But I won't link to that because it would identify me.

I want to run singular applications and connect to them from all of my devices concurrently.

In the disappointing real world, most cross-device applications are intermediated by proprietary cloud functionality, subject to the constraints and limited functionality imagined by the vendors.  For example, I can take photos on a camera and access them from my desktop via by my OneDrive account once the camera uploads the photo.  (I'd prefer that my phone just push the photo to my own file system.)

Theoretically, you can use state synchronization of things like bookmarks and browsing history, but this is error-prone and fragile.
